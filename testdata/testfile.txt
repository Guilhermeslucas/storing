This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers 
strictly adherent to a simple set of rules. Test ideas by 
experiments and observations. Build on those ideas that pass 
the test. Reject the ones that fail. Follow the evidence 
wherever it leads, and question everything. Accept these terms, 
and the cosmos is yours.
